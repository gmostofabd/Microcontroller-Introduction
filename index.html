		<h3>Introduction:</h3>
      <blockquote>
		  <p>
        This is the first in a long line of tutorials aimed to provide a beginners guide 
        and tutorial based around the Atmel 8051 Microcontroller. It will show you, 
        through examples and projects, how to program and provide functions for this 
        microcontroller and what the uses and applications are. Before we learn Embedded 
        System, lets learn: what is a System?

         <br><br>A system is an arrangement where all its component work according to the 
         specific defined rules. It is a method of organizing, working, or performing one 
         or more tasks according to a fixed plan. For example, a watch is a time displaying 
         system. Its components follow a set of rules to show time. If one of its parts 
         fails, the watch will stop working. So we can say, in a system, all its sub-components 
         depend on each other. Our talks about embedded system. An embedded system can be 
         thought of as a computer hardware system having software embedded in it. Our talks 
         about embedded system.

      <h3>Embedded System</h3>
        <div class="box_70"><img src="assets/images/Embedded-systems2.jpg"/><span class="capt_cont">Fig: embedded system</span></div>

      <blockquote>
        <p>
          An embedded system is typically some combination of hardware and software, either 
          fixed in function or programmable.  An embedded system could be designed to support a 
          specific function or functions within a larger system.  Examples include industrial 
          control systems and machines, automobiles, military systems such as avionics and 
          weapons system, medical equipment, consumer products, smartphones, and building 
          automation.

      <h3>Characteristics of an Embedded System :</h3>            
        <div class="box_70"><img src="assets/images/es_charac.png"/><span class="capt_cont">Fig: Embedded System Characteristics</span></div>



      <h3>Components of an Embedded System :</h3>
      <div class="box_70"><img src="assets/images/es_comp.png"/><span class="capt_cont">Fig: Basic Components of an Embedded System</span></div>

      <p>An embedded system has three major components as below:</p>
        <ul class="ul_gen">
          <li><strong>Hardware :</strong> An embedded system uses a hardware platform to perform the operation. 
            Hardware of the embedded system is assembled with a microprocessor/microcontroller. It has the 
            elements such as input/output interfaces, memory, user interface and the display unit.</li>
          <li><strong>Application Software :</strong> The software of an embedded system is written to execute a particular 
            function. It is normally written in a programming language (Assembly, C, Python or such) and 
            then compiled down to offer code that can be stuck within a non-volatile memory in the hardware.</li>
          <li><strong>RTOS</strong>: A Real Time Operating System, commonly known as an RTOS, is a software 
            component that rapidly switches between tasks, giving the impression that multiple programs are 
            being executed at the same time on a single processing core. It offers scheduling, Priority, 
            Multitasking, Memory-Data-Object-Class Management, Library Management etc.</li>
        </ul>


        <h3>Processors</h3>
        <blockquote>
          <p>
            Processor is the heart of an embedded system as it is responsible for interpreting most of 
            computers commands. It is the basic unit that takes inputs and produces an output after 
            processing the data. For an embedded system designer, it is necessary to have the knowledge 
            of both microprocessors and microcontrollers.
          </p>
        </blockquote>

        <h3>A processor has two essential units:</h3>
        <ul class="ul_gen">
          <li><strong>Control unit:</strong> This unit in processors performed the program flow control 
            operation inside an embedded system. The control unit also acts as a fetching unit for 
            fetching the set of instructions stored inside a memory.</li>
          <li><strong>Execution unit:</strong> This unit is used for execution the various tasks inside 
            a processors. It mainly comprises of arithmetic and logical unit (ALU) and it also include 
            a circuit that executes the instruction sets used to perform program control operation inside 
            processors. A processor runs the cycles of fetch and executes the instructions in the same 
            sequence as they are fetched from memory.</li>
        </ul>


        <h3>Processor Architecture</h3>
          <div class="box_70"><img src="assets/images/harvard_vs_vonneu2.png"/><span class="capt_cont">Fig: Harvard and Von Neumann</span></div>


        <h3>Von Neumann Architecture</h3>
        <blockquote>
          <p>
            The Von Neumann architecture was first proposed by a computer scientist John Von Neumann. 
            In this architecture, one data path or bus exists for both instruction and data. As a result, 
            the CPU does one operation at a time. It either fetches an instruction from memory, or 
            performs read/write operation on data. So an instruction fetch 
            and a data operation cannot occur simultaneously, sharing a common bus.
          </p>
        </blockquote>

        <h3>Harvard Architecture</h3>

        <blockquote>
          <p>
            The Harvard architecture offers separate storage and signal buses for instructions and data. 
            This architecture has data storage entirely contained within the CPU, and there is no access 
            to the instruction storage as data. Computers have separate memory areas for program 
            instructions and data using internal data buses, allowing simultaneous access to both 
            instructions and data.

            <br><br>Programs needed to be loaded by an operator; the processor could not boot itself. 
            In a Harvard architecture, there is no need to make the two memories share properties.
          </p>
        </blockquote>

        <h3>Types of Processors</h3>

        <p>Processors can be of the following categories:</p>

        <ul class="ul_gen">
          <li><strong>Application Specific System Processor(ASSP):</strong> ASSP is application dependent 
            system processor used for processing signal of embedded system. Therefore for different 
            application performing task a unique set of system processors is required.</li>
          <li><strong>Application Specific Instruction Processor(ASIP):</strong> ASIP is application 
            dependent instruction processors. It is used for processing the various instruction set inside 
            a combinational circuit of an embedded system.</li>
          <li><strong>General Purpose Processor (GPP):</strong>: GPP is used for processing signal from 
            input to output by controlling the operation of system bus, address bus and data bus inside 
            an embedded system.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Types of general purpose processor are:</p>
        <ul class="ul_gen">
          <li><strong>Microprocessor -</strong> The microprocessor is a multipurpose, clock-driven, 
            register-based, digital integrated circuit that accepts binary data as input, processes 
            it according to instructions stored in its memory, and provides results 
            (also in binary form) as output.</li>
          <li><strong>Microcontroller -</strong> A microcontroller is a compact integrated circuit 
            designed to govern a specific operation in an embedded system. A typical microcontroller 
            includes a processor, memory and input/output (I/O) peripherals on a single chip.This is 
            the device will will continue to learn in deep.</li>
          <li><strong>DSP - </strong> Digital Signal Processing involves the interchanging of information 
            so that said information can be observed, analyzed, or transformed into a separate form of signal.</li>
          <li><strong>ASP - </strong> (Analog signal processing) processes the signals which are not 
            digitized. The examples of ASP systems include classical radio, TV, telephone, radar etc.</li>
  
        </ul>
  
        <h3>Components of Microprocessor</h3>
        <blockquote>
          <p>
            A microprocessor is an electronic component that is used by a computer to do its work. 
            It is a central processing unit on a single integrated circuit chip containing millions 
            of very small components including transistors, resistors, and diodes that work together.

            <br><br>Operations performed by microprocessor are adding, subtracting, comparing two 
            numbers and fetching the data from memory for transferring it from one place to another.

              perform the arithmetic and logic operation. It performs the logic operation on the data 
              stored inside a register.</li>
            <li><strong>Accumulator:</strong> It is a register inside which the intermediate arithmetic 
              and logical operation data is stored.</li>
            <li><strong>Working registers:</strong> It is a storage device used to store the data 
              inside a microprocessor in different address location.</li>

              executed inside a microprocessor.</li>
            <li><strong>Stack pointer:</strong> Stack pointer act as a pointer to the certain 
              address. It is a register used to store the address of the last program request 
              made by the processor inside a stack.</li>
            <li><strong>Clock circuit:</strong> It is used for generate the clock pulse required as 
              a reference signal for the microprocessor.</li>
            <li><strong>Interrupt circuit:</strong> It is used for generating the interrupt signal 
              when the higher priority process required to be served first on basis of priority 
              by microprocessor.</li>

              You can think of a microcontroller like a tiny computer. You can connect things, 
              like a small display, some buttons, a motor and some sensors. And you can put 
              programs onto it and run them.

              A microcontroller (MCU for microcontroller unit) is a small computer on a single 
              integrated circuit (IC) chip. It contains one or more CPUs (processor cores) along 
              with memory and programmable input/output peripherals. They are used for controlling 
              other portions of an electronic system, usually via a microprocessor unit (MPU), 
              memory, and some peripherals. These devices are optimized for embedded applications 
              that require both processing functionality and agile, responsive interaction with 
              digital, analog, or electromechanical components.
